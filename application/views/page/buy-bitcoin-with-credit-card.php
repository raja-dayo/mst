					<h1>A Complete Guide on Buying and Selling Bitcoin</h1>
<p>Bitcoin is the latest type of digital currency that was created back in 2009. There is no information about the person behind its creation, but an alias, Satoshi Nakamoto, is often associated with its introduction. The most amazing thing about bitcoin is that there is no middle person involved. It means you can transfer money without a bank, transfer service, or person, and surprisingly, it is much safer than regular money exchange, transfer, and deposit online. Despite the popularity and trend of using bitcoin, there is not much information about buying bitcoin. Buying bitcoin requires any fiat currencies, for example, USD. It can also be purchased through other types of cryptocurrencies. Here are some of the options to buy and sell bitcoin.</p>
